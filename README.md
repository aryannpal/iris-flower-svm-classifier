# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using SVM

This project classifies iris flower species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The prediction is based on five morphological features:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

To enhance accuracy, the model is optimized using **GridSearchCV**, which tunes SVM hyperparameters like kernel type, `C`, and `gamma`.
